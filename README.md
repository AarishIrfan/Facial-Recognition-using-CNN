# Facial Recognition using CNN

This project demonstrates facial recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The primary goal is to develop a model capable of accurately identifying and verifying individuals' faces.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes CNNs to analyze and recognize facial features from images. It includes various stages from preprocessing the data, building and training the model, to evaluating its performance.
